# manage-it
This is an record management system for apartments to use. 

Every housing society needs to maintain data bases of all the residents and tenants. The data base of the apartments is required for general purpose like to send notices, bills and etc. Using this program the database of the flats can be created, modified and deleted. The same can be used to search any data whenever required. 

It helps the staff to maintain and supervise the records of all residents and tenants and retrieve them whenever they want. 

The motive of this program is to dilute the work of office staffs and to reduce the use of paper.
